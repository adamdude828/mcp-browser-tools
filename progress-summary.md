# Browser Connect Project - Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Modularize window.js âœ…
We've successfully modularized the window.js file by:
- Creating a `js/modules` directory structure
- Implementing these modules:
  - `SocketConnectionManager.js` - Handles socket.io connection and events
  - `TabManager.js` - Manages browser tabs and tab selection
  - `UIUpdater.js` - Handles UI rendering and updates
  - `ElementSelectionManager.js` - Manages element selection functionality
- Updating `window.js` to use these modules with ES modules syntax
- Updating `window.html` to support ES modules
- Updating `manifest.json` to include modules as web-accessible resources

Additionally, we fixed a bug where element highlights (borders) weren't being cleared when switching between tabs by:
- Adding tracking of the previous tab in TabManager
- Implementing `_clearPreviousTabHighlights()` method in TabManager
- Adding a new message handler for `clear-all-highlights` in content-script.js
- Adding a new `clearElementHighlights()` function in content-script.js
- Ensuring highlight state is reset properly in ElementSelectionManager

**Note:** We still need to update project-context.mdc with details about the module structure and relationships created during this task.

## Upcoming Tasks

### 2. Modularize content-script.js
The content-script.js file (723 lines) needs to be modularized.

### 3. Modularize popup.js
The popup.js file (612 lines) needs to be modularized.

### 4. Create Shared Utilities
Extract common code into shared utility modules.

### 5. Implement TypeScript
Convert the codebase to TypeScript.

### 6-10. Server Improvements and Documentation
Various HTTP server improvements and documentation tasks are pending.

## Next Steps

1. **Update project-context.mdc** with the modular architecture we've implemented for window.js to help future LLM sessions understand where to place code and how components interact.

2. Tackle task #2 - modularizing content-script.js using a similar approach to what we did with window.js. We should create modules for:
   - Element highlighting
   - Element selection
   - UI/Modal handling
   - DOM interaction utilities

Each task should now include updating the project-context.mdc file to document the changes, making it easier for future LLM sessions to understand the project structure and know where to place new code.
